          Weâ€™ll analyze and solve your particular performance issue. If your app
          loads slowly, or a page freezes when you use it, this is for you.
        </p>
        <p>We wonâ€™t take money if weâ€™re unable to solve the issue.</p>
      </Column>
      <Column>
        <H3>Keep the app fast</H3>
        <p>
          Once per month, weâ€™ll analyze your app and fix all the performance
          issues we can find. If you want to never think about your appâ€™s speed
          again, this is for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make this reliable, weâ€™ll define specific performance budgets
          (loading time or app size) and keep the app inside them.
