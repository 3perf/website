1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,610
WebPageTest is an advanced
performance analysis tool.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,620
It's available at webpagetest.org,
it's free, and it traces how the

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,330
page loads and  gives back lots of
information in an easy to consume share.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,549
Yeah, it looks a bit dated and it
could be too advanced at times, but

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,879
that's probably its only drawback,
and I really love it, otherwise.

6
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:23,883
And in this case, I'm going to use
WebPageTest to, and I'm going to

7
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:27,433
show you how to use WebPageTest,
to look at the loading waterfall

8
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:31,953
and figure out why CNN’s largest
contentful paint is so, well, large.

9
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:37,563
So in order to do that, what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go to WebPageTest.

10
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,513
I am already here.

11
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:45,246
I'm going to copy the  URL
of the page that we are going

12
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,076
to analyze and paste it here.

13
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:52,576
Then I'm going to change the browser
settings to Moto G 4, Chrome.

14
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:55,716
So, one thing I love about
WebPageTest is that it allows you

15
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:57,576
to test on real mobile device.

16
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:00,696
It's not just, not just simulated
mobile, like in Lighthouse, but,

17
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:03,666
or real, cheap, slow mobile phones.

18
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:04,836
And.

19
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:09,916
I'm also going to change the connection
settings to 4g,  to make it closer

20
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:11,536
to what PageSpeed Insights runs with.

21
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:13,846
And I'm going to start the test.

22
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,046
So, to save time, I'm not going
to  wait until the test finishes,

23
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:19,756
I already have a completed test.

24
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:26,871
And the test page has a lot of things, it
could be a bit  overwhelming initially,

25
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:33,231
but basically there are two pieces,
there are two kinds of information

26
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:36,531
I'm currently caring about here.

27
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,551
And the first piece is web vitals.

28
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:43,581
What PageSpeed Insight does, it
measures web vitals right on the device

29
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:47,971
we are doing the testing at, and in
this case we can see that, well, web

30
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:52,501
vitals measured at this Moto G4 phone,
actually, yeah, look not so good.

31
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:57,551
And the second piece that I'm currently
interested in is the network waterfall.

32
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:01,647
Network waterfall is waterfall of all
resources that are loaded over network.

33
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,377
And it's located right here.

34
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,647
It'spretty large.

35
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:08,807
CNN downloads quite a lot of stuff.

36
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:11,367
And I'm pretty sure most
of that  is third parties.

37
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,497
That's, like, it's
typically third parties.

38
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:16,437
And that's probably the reason
why total blocking time is

39
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:19,647
high, but we'll get to that.

40
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,727
Right now, we're talking about largest
contentful paint, so let’s focus on that
