1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,640
So, how do you check if this has
an effect, how do you check if

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,950
your server is actually slow?

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,470
This is easy to do both in
WebPageTest and in Chrome DevTools.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,700
So in WebPageTest, you
have this huge waterfall.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,610
So what you do is you click that
waterfall, you wait until it loads,

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:23,300
and in this enlarged format, in the
large shape and you scroll down and

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,720
you click on some network resources,
like say the index.html response.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,540
This opens a dialogue with a detailed
information with like- actually one thing,

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,300
one thing that's great here is that a
lot of information here is not present

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,089
in Chrome DevTools, so if you are doing
advanced network debugging, this is

11
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,919
like super great and super convenient.

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,660
But yeah, this open a dialog with the
detailed information and there's a lot

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,110
of stuff here, but what we actually care
about is the time to first byte row.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,610
Here it is.

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,864
And in this case, time to first
byte measured by WebPageTest

16
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:01,344
is 196 milliseconds, which
is actually pretty good.

17
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:04,794
And if you're in Chrome dev
tools, this is easy to do as well.

18
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:11,184
So what you do is you open the page,
then you open the browser dev tools.

19
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:16,884
You reload the page, you make sure you
have the network pane open, and once

20
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:20,964
resources start loading, you click on
any network resource, like, say, again,

21
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:24,995
index.html, you switched to the timing
tab, which is already open in my case.

22
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:28,705
And you look at the waiting
(time to first bite) value.

23
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:32,945
And in this case, the time to first
value is 40 milliseconds, which is even

24
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:34,715
better than what WebPageTest measured.

25
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:36,695
This is, this is really cool.

26
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:42,345
So yeah, in this case, both in
WebPageTest and in Chrome DevTools,

27
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:45,995
the time to first bite value is great.

28
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:50,475
In my experience, or in my opinion,
rather, I would say that any value

29
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:53,775
below 300 milliseconds is pretty good.

30
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:58,320
So in the CNN case, the server
slowness doesn't seem to be the issue.
