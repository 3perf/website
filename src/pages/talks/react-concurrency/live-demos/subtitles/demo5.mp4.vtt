00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 So if I switch to Chrome DevTools,

00:02.280 --> 00:07.360
 and if I compare the time it took for the list

00:07.360 --> 00:16.800
 to re-render in the blocking version that was 600 milliseconds

00:16.800 --> 00:29.480
 versus non-blocking version, this took 900 milliseconds.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.080
 So the numbers would vary every time.

00:33.080 --> 00:38.800
 It's not always 30 milliseconds longer, like 50% longer.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.400
 Sometimes it's just a little bit.

00:40.400 --> 00:47.440
 What you see in this case, when the update was urgent,

00:47.440 --> 00:52.560
 the list of notes re-rendered faster, sooner.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.320
 And when the update was non-urgent,

00:56.320 --> 00:58.360
 it took more time for React to finish

00:58.360 --> 00:59.920
 re-rendering the whole list and to display

00:59.920 --> 01:02.240
 the result on the screen.

01:02.240 --> 01:18.600
 So non-urgent updates take a bit longer.
