There‚Äôre multiple ways to improve web performance (see [Web Performance 101](http://3perf.com/talks/web-perf-101) for a full overview). One of those ways is to preload content you‚Äôll need later in advance. Prefetch a CSS file, prerender a full page, or resolve a domain ahead of time ‚Äì and you won‚Äôt have to wait for it when it‚Äôs actually needed! Sounds cool.

What‚Äôs even cooler is that browsers have a simple built-in way to do all these things. There‚Äôre five `<link rel>` tags that instruct the browser to preload something:

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="/style.css" as="style" />
<link rel="preload" href="/style.css" as="style" />

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com" />
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com" />

<link rel="prerender" href="https://example.com/about.html" />
```

Here‚Äôs what they each of them does and when to use them.

## preload

`<link rel="preload">` tells the browser to download and cache a resource (like a script or a stylesheet) as soon as possible. It‚Äôs helpful when you need that resource a few seconds after loading the page, and you want to speed it up.

The browser doesn‚Äôt do anything with the resource after downloading it. Scripts aren‚Äôt executed, stylesheets aren‚Äôt applied. It‚Äôs just cached ‚Äì so that when something else needs it, it‚Äôs available immediately.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/style.css" as="style" />
```

`href` points to the resource you want to download.

`as` can be anything you can download in a browser:

- `style` for stylesheets,
- `script` for scripts,
- `font` for fonts,
- `fetch` for resources downloaded with `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`,
- other values ‚Äì see the full list [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content#What_types_of_content_can_be_preloaded)

It‚Äôs important to specify the `as` attribute ‚Äì it helps the browser to prioritize and schedule the download properly.

### When to use

**Use it when you‚Äôll need a resource soon.** `<link rel="preload">` will help when you know you‚Äôll need a resource soon after loading the page, and you want to start loading it earlier. For example:

- You use custom fonts. The `@font-face` rule that applies those fonts is in an external CSS file:

  ```html
  <!-- index.html -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" />
  ```

  ```css
  /* index.css */
  @font-face {
    ¬†¬†src: url('comic-sans.woff2') format('woff2');
  }
  ```

  By default, `comic-sans.woff2` will start downloading only when `index.css` is fetched and applied. Instead of waiting for it that long, use `<link rel="preload">` to initiate the download sooner:

  ```html
  <link rel="preload" href="comic-sans.woff2" as="font" />
  ```

- You split your styles per [the Critical CSS approach](https://3perf.com/talks/web-perf-101/#css-block-rendering-1). With this approach, you‚Äôll split your CSS into two parts ‚Äì critical (required for immediate rendering) and non-critical:

  ```html
  <style>
    /* Inlined critical styles */
  </style>

  <script>
    /* Custom JS that starts downloading non-critical styles */
    loadCSS('/app/non-critical.css');
  </script>
  ```

  With this approach, non-critical styles will start downloading only when JavaScript starts executing ‚Äì which can be a few seconds after the first render. Instead of waiting for JS to execute, use `<link rel="preload">` to initiate the download sooner:

  ```html
  <style>
    /* Inlined critical styles */
  </style>

  <link rel="preload" href="/app/non-critical.css" as="style" />

  <script>
    /* Custom JS that starts downloading non-critical styles */
    loadCSS('/app/non-critical.css');
  </script>
  ```

**Don‚Äôt overuse it.** Preloading everything won‚Äôt magically speed up the site ‚Äì instead, it will likely prevent the browser from scheduling everything smartly.

**Don‚Äôt confuse with `prefetch`.** Don‚Äôt use `<link rel="preload">` if you don‚Äôt need a resource immediately after the page loads. If you only need it later ‚Äì e.g., for a next page ‚Äì use `<link rel="prefetch">`.

### More details

**It‚Äôs mandatory.** Unlike all other preload-related `<link>` tags, this tag is mandatory for the browser (if it supports the tag). A browser _has_ to download the resource specified in `<link rel="preload">`. With other tags described here, a browser is free to skip preloading the resource if it decides to ‚Äì e.g. if the network is slow.

**Priorities.** For different kinds of resources (styles, scripts, fonts, etc.), browsers typically assign different priorities. This allows for downloading the most important resources first. For a resource fetched with `<link rel="preload">`, browsers use the `as` attribute to determine its priority. For Chrome, see [the full table of Chrome priorities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bCDuq9H1ih9iNjgzyAL0gpwNFiEP4TZS-YLRp_RuMlc/edit#) for more details

## prefetch

`<link rel="prefetch">` asks the browser to download and cache a resource (like, a script or a stylesheet) in the background. The download happens with a low priority, so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with more important resources. It‚Äôs helpful when you know you‚Äôll need that resource on a subsequent page, and you want to cache it ahead of time.

The browser doesn‚Äôt do anything with the resource after downloading it. Scripts aren‚Äôt executed, stylesheets aren‚Äôt applied. It‚Äôs just cached ‚Äì so that when something else needs it, it‚Äôs available immediately.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="/style.css" as="style" />
```

`href` points to the resource you want to download.

`as` can be anything you can download in a browser:

- `style` for stylesheets,
- `script` for scripts,
- `font` for fonts,
- `fetch` for resources downloaded with `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`,
- other values ‚Äì see the full list [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content#What_types_of_content_can_be_preloaded)

It‚Äôs important to specify the `as` attribute ‚Äì it helps the browser to prioritize and schedule the download properly.

### When to use

**Use it for resources from other pages.** `<link rel="prefetch">` will help if you need a resource on a different page, and you want to preload it and speed up rendering of that page. For example:

- You have an e-commerce site, and 40% of your users go from the home page to a product page. Use `<link rel="prefetch">` to download CSS and JS files responsible for rendering product pages

- You have a single-page app, and you code-split it so that different pages load different bundles. When a user visits some page, ask your router what other pages it links to, and use `<link rel="prefetch">` to preload bundles for those pages

**It‚Äôs probably safe to use it as much as you want.** Browsers usually schedule prefetches with the lowest priority, so they don‚Äôt interfere with other resources. This means it‚Äôs probably safe to prefetch a lot of stuff. Keep in mind though that this will still use the user‚Äôs data ‚Äì and there‚Äôs a chance that‚Äôll cost them money!

**Don‚Äôt use for urgent resources.** Don‚Äôt use `<link rel="prefetch">` when you‚Äôll need a resource in a few seconds. In this case, use `<link rel="preload">` instead.

### More details

**Not mandatory.** The browser is _not_ required to follow the `<link rel="prefetch">` instruction. This means it can decide not to fetch the resource ‚Äì e.g. if the connection is slow.

**Priorities in Chrome.** In Chrome, `<link rel="prefetch">` downloads are usually prioritized with the lowest priority ([full table of priorities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bCDuq9H1ih9iNjgzyAL0gpwNFiEP4TZS-YLRp_RuMlc/edit)). This means they are usually scheduled after everything else got loaded.

## preconnect

`<link rel="preconnect">` asks the browser to perform a connection to a domain in advance. It‚Äôs helpful when you know you‚Äôll download something from that domain soon, but you don‚Äôt know what exactly, and you want to speed up the initial connection.

A browser has to set up a connection when it retrieves something from a new third-party domain. (A third-party domain is a domain that‚Äôs different from the one your app is hosted on.) This may happen when a site uses a font from Google Fonts, loads React from a CDN, or requests a JSON response from an API server.

Setting up a new connection typically takes several hundred milliseconds. It‚Äôs only needed once per domain, but it still takes time. If you set up a connection in advance, you‚Äôll save that time and load resources from that domain faster.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://api.my-app.com" />
```

`href` points to the domain name you want to resolve. Feel free to specify it with the scheme (`https://domain.com`) or without it (`//domain.com`), it would work the same.

### When to use

**Use it for domains you‚Äôll need shortly.** `<link rel="preconnect" />` will help you when you have an important style, script, or image on a third-party domain, but you don‚Äôt know the resource URL yet. For example:

- Your app is hosted at `my-app.com`, and it makes AJAX requests to `api.my-app.com`. You don‚Äôt know what specific requests you‚Äôll be making to that domain ‚Äì because you make them dynamically from JS.

  Use `<link rel="preconnect">` to connect to `api.my-app.com` in advance and make the first data request faster

- Your app is hosted at `my-app.com`, and it uses Google Fonts. Google Fonts load fonts in two stages: first, a CSS file is downloaded from `fonts.googleapis.com`; then, that CSS file requests fonts from `fonts.gstatic.com`.

  You can‚Äôt know what specific font files from `fonts.gstatic.com` you‚Äôll need until you download the CSS file from `fonts.googleapis.com`. Use `<link rel="preconnect">` to set up a connection in advance

**Use it to slightly speed up some third-party script or style.** If you have a third-party resource in the page that you really need to load sooner, add `<link rel="preconnect" />` for that domain. It will instruct the browser to setup connection for that domain sooner.

**Don‚Äôt overuse it.** Setting up and keeping a connection open is costly ‚Äì both for a client and a server. Use this tag for 4-6 domains at most.

### More details

**Not mandatory.** The browser is _not_ required to follow a `<link rel="preconnect">` instruction. This means it can decide not to set up a new connection ‚Äì e.g., if there‚Äôre already a lot of connections set up, or in some other case.

**What the connection process includes.** To connect to each site, a browser has to perform the following steps:

- _DNS resolution._ Find a server‚Äôs IP address (`216.58.215.78`) for a specified domain name (`google.com`)

- _TCP handshake._ Perform a roundtrip (a message goes client ‚Üí server ‚Üí client) to initiate a TCP connection to a server

- _TLS handshake (only for HTTPS sites)._ Perform two roundtrips (a message goes client ‚Üí server ‚Üí client ‚Üí server ‚Üí client) to initiate a secure TLS session

Note: this will change with HTTP/3 as it‚Äôs going to [improve and speed up the connection mechanism](https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/feature-handshakes.html). That‚Äôs still far ahead though.

## dns-prefetch

`<link rel="dns-prefetch">` asks the browser to perform a DNS resolution of a domain in advance. It‚Äôs helpful when you know you‚Äôll connect to that domain soon, and you want to speed up the initial connection.

A browser has to perform a DNS resolution when it connects to a new third-party domain. (A third-party domain is a domain that‚Äôs different from the one your app is hosted on.) This may happen when your site uses a font from Google Fonts, loads React from a CDN, or requests a JSON response from your API server.

For each new domain, resolving the DNS record usually [takes around 20-120 ms](https://www.keycdn.com/support/reduce-dns-lookups). It only affects the first resource downloaded from that domain, but it still matters. If you perform a DNS resolution in advance, you‚Äôll save that time and load that resource faster.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://api.my-app.com" />
```

`href` points to the domain name you want to resolve. Feel free to specify it with the scheme (`https://domain.com`) or without it (`//domain.com`), it would work the same.

### When to use

**Use it for domains you‚Äôll need shortly.** `<link rel="dns-prefetch" />` will help you when you have some important resources on third-party domains the browser doesn‚Äôt know about in advance. For example:

- Your app is hosted at `my-app.com`, and it makes AJAX requests to `api.my-app.com`. The browser doesn‚Äôt know that you‚Äôll be making requests to that domain ‚Äì because you make them from JS.

  Use `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` to resolve `api.my-app.com` and make the first data request faster

- Your app is hosted at `my-app.com`, and it uses Google Fonts. Google Fonts load fonts in two stages: first, a CSS file is downloaded from `fonts.googleapis.com`; then, that CSS file requests fonts from `fonts.gstatic.com`.

  The browser doesn‚Äôt know that you‚Äôll load fonts from `fonts.gstatic.com`, so use `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` to resolve it in advance

**Use it to slightly speed up some third-party script or style.** If you have a third-party resource in the page that you really need to load sooner, add `<link rel="dns-prefetch" />` for that domain. It will instruct the browser to schedule DNS resolution for that domain sooner.

<div class="note">

**Note on `<link rel="dns-prefetch" />` and `<link rel="preconnect" />`.** Using both of these tags for the same domain is not really useful ‚Äì `<link rel="preconnect" />` already includes everything `<link rel="dns-prefetch" />` does, and more. However, it can still make sense in two cases:

- _You want to support older browsers._ `<link rel="dns-prefetch" />` is supported [starting from IE10 and Safari 5](https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-dns-prefetch). `<link rel="preconnect" />` has been supported in Chrome and Firefox for a while, but was added to Safari only in 11.1, and [still isn‚Äôt supported in IE/Edge](https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preconnect). If you need to support those browsers, use `<link rel="dns-prefetch" />` as a fallback for `<link rel="preconnect" />`.

- _You want to speed up more than 4-6 domains_. It‚Äôs not recommended to use `<link rel="preconnect" />` with more than 4-6 domains, as opening and keeping a connection is an expensive operation. `<link rel="dns-prefetch" />` is more lightweight, so use it for other third-party domains if you want to speed them up too.

</div>

### More details

**Not mandatory.** The browser is _not_ required to follow a `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` instruction. This means it can decide not to perform the DNS resolve ‚Äì e.g., if there's already a lot of them, or in some other case.

**What is DNS.** Each server on the internet is addressed by a unique IP address which looks like `216.58.215.78`. However, when you visit a site, you don‚Äôt type a server‚Äôs IP address ‚Äì you use a site domain (like `google.com`). This works thanks to DNS (Domain Name System) servers ‚Äì servers that map a domain (`google.com`) to a server‚Äôs IP address (`216.58.215.78`).

To resolve a domain name, the browser has to perform a request to a DNS server. This is what takes those 20-120 ms when you connect to a new third-party domain.

**DNS is cached, though not reliably.** Some operating systems and browsers cache your DNS requests. This would save time if you need to retrieve something from a third-party domain again ‚Äì but don‚Äôt rely on it. Linux typically [doesn‚Äôt have DNS caching at all](https://stackoverflow.com/q/11020027/1192426). Chrome has a DNS cache, but [it only lives for a minute](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/363498/19889). Windows caches DNS responses [for 5 days](https://www.itprotoday.com/cloud-computing/how-can-i-configure-how-long-dns-cache-stores-positive-and-negative-responses).

## prerender

`<link rel="prerender">` asks the browser to load a URL and render it in an invisible tab. When a user clicks on a link to that URL, the page should be rendered immediately. It‚Äôs helpful when you‚Äôre really sure a user will visit a specific page next, and you want to render it faster.

Despite (or because of?) its power, in 2019, `<link rel="prerender">` has bad support in major browsers. See [More details](#more-details-4) for more.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="prerender" href="https://my-app.com/pricing" />
```

`href` points to the URL you want to render in the background.

### When to use

**When you‚Äôre really sure a user will go to some page next.** If you have a conversion funnel where 70% of visitors go from page A to page B, `<link rel="prerender" />` in page A might help to render page B super-quickly.

**Don‚Äôt overuse it.** Pre-rendering a page is extremely costly ‚Äì both in terms of traffic and memory. Don‚Äôt use `<link rel="prerender" />` for more than one page.

### More details

**Not mandatory.** The browser is _not_ required to follow a `<link rel="prerender">` instruction. This means it can decide not to perform the prerender ‚Äì e.g., if the memory is low, or the connection is slow.

**Chrome doesn‚Äôt do a full render.** Instead of a full render, Chrome [makes a _NoState Prefetch_](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/nostate-prefetch) to save memory. This means Chrome downloads the page and all subsequent resources, but doesn‚Äôt render it or execute JavaScript.

**Firefox and Safari don‚Äôt support this tag at all.** This doesn‚Äôt break the specification, as browsers are not required to act on the tag; but this is still quite sad. Firefox has [an implementation bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=730101) which has been open for 7 years; and there are reports that state [Safari doesn‚Äôt support it too](https://twitter.com/bluesmoon/status/1108412360828563456).

## Summing up

Use:

- `<link rel="preload">` ‚Äì when you‚Äôll need a resource in a few seconds
- `<link rel="prefetch">` ‚Äì when you‚Äôll need a resource on a next page
- `<link rel="preconnect">` ‚Äì when you know you‚Äôll need a resource soon, but you don‚Äôt know its full url yet
- `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` ‚Äì also when you know you‚Äôll need a resource soon, but you don‚Äôt know its full url yet (for older browsers)
- `<link rel="prerender">` ‚Äì when you‚Äôre certain users will navigate to a specific page, and you want to speed it up
